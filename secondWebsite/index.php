    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my website.  Here, I will be 100% dedicated to learning Bulgarian, my mother's tongue, and helping you doing the same along the way.</p>

    <h2> Are you ready??? </h2>
    <p>  Alright, we'll get going. However, firstly I'd like to thank my <b>mom</b>, for giving me this challenge today (better late than never!). 
    I'm also thanking <b>Big Sis</b>, who suggested the great book that is <i>Le Bulgare sans peine</i>, from the <i>Assimil collection</i>. 
    Thanks to the Assimil team, huge props to all of you guys! As for you, the <b>readers</b>, if you go get this book (at BAnQ or as an online purchase), 
     make sure you get the big, complete version and not the puny one... Take the one with the audio CDs included, you'll thank me later! 
     (As I thanked Big Sis just a tiny bit earlier today ;)

    Last but not least, many thanks to any Bulgarian in my surroundings who is willing to help me, with their patience and knowledge of the language.
    <b>Dre D.</b>, I'm looking your way! As for you, <b>Timousse</b>, your <i>"pet pile"</i> makes me laugh everytime... you deserve your name in my
     <b>THANK YOU</b> 
    list because without you, this website would have never existed, ever, and that's the truth!

    <h3> Step #1 </h3>
   <p> If you're like me, you already know how to say <strong>"Dober Den" </strong> (bonjour, hi) <span lang="bg">Добър ден</span> and you have at least a very vague idea of the alphabet.
    (If not, take a look at <a href="http://www.roumiana.com/cours_alphabet.htm">this</a> )</p>
