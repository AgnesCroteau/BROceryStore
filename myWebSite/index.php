    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p><strong>Welcome to my website!</strong>
    First, let me introduce myself.  My name is ALICE, and I'm dating BOB. </p>
    <h2>We met at Chapters and it's been heaven on earth ever since.</h2>
    <p>I knew something was up when I saw his pretty face with his huge, glossy eyes.  However, it's his body odour that first got me hooked.</p>
    <p>'' Do you come here often? '' he said.</p>
    <p>'' Always! '' I answered, trying to look honest.  It was the first time I'd actually come accross the Computer section. I was completely lost.</p>
    <p> Later on, I realized loving him was in my <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. </p>
    <p><abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> BOB, boy were you hot. CHEEEEEEEEESYYYYYYYYY!</p>
